We adopted a cost recovery approach (Lange and Hassan, 2006) in determining a minimum estimate for the value of the water services of the Succulent Karoo which excludes any benefits or value derived from that water, and ignores the role that ecosystems play in the supply of water. In addition to this method we estimated the total value of the economy (GVA) as an indication of the upper value of the water services, and therefore includes those benefits and the ecological role that it plays excluded by the cost recovery approach. We acknowledge that attributing GVA to water when water is only one of several inputs is incorrect; the GVA is derived from several inputs and will, therefore, overestimate the value of water. Using the GVA also involves double counting where for example water is valued for the grazing it provides to livestock and the livestock sales are reflected in the total GVA. However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure. Infrastructure includes formal infrastructure used by water user associations and municipalities, and informal infrastructure like private boreholes or even communal water supply mechanisms. We defined the URV as the present value of all costs (PVC), divided by the present value of all of yields or savings and benefits (PVB) incurred over the economic life span of the water supply infrastructure. Total yield is estimated by multiplying the expected annual yield with the supply scheme/infrastructure life span. This value is presented in a volumetric unit ($/m3) and is considered to be a minimum estimate of the relative value of water. URV is therefore a reversed benefit cost ratio (BCR), (BCR ¼ 1/URV). Thisvalue should only be used for comparing the different water supply alternatives in the same region, since the actual values of a unit of water vary widely in the different areas and the accepted cost per m3 will differ as well. In addition the URV is heavily dependant on the consistency of counting all the different cost and benefits that occur over the set life span of the supply scheme, which is debatable too. We extracted data from a provincial survey (De Lange, 2006) on water user associations in the Western Cape to obtain estimates regarding tariffs and volumes relevant to our study area. The survey excluded the City of Cape Town metropolis, but still represented 53.1% of all municipal and agricultural water use in the Western Cape (De Lange and Kleynhans, 2007, 2008). Cost data relating to the type of bulk supply infrastructure, source of supply, number of members, enlistment, types of user and annual tariffs were obtained from water user associations relevant to our study area (De Lange, 2006). A distinction was made between serviced and raw water, with the former being significantly more expensive because of additional built in services (filtration, chlorination, stabilisation and pressurisation). Borehole water was handled separately. Cost estimates for each source were based on survey data and reconciled with unpublished estimates from theWestern Cape provincial department of Agriculture’s engineering services unit (De Lange, 2006). We calculated from the survey data (De Lange, 2006) that 85.3% of the surface water consumed in the study area is sold as raw surface water at $ 0.018/m3 while the remaining 14.7% is supplied as serviced water at $ 0.674/m3.

We adopted a cost recovery approach (Lange and Hassan, 2006) in determining a minimum estimate for the value of the water services of the Succulent Karoo which excludes any benefits or value derived from that water, and ignores the role that ecosystems play in the supply of water. In addition to this method we estimated the total value of the economy (GVA) as an indication of the upper value of the water services, and therefore includes those benefits and the ecological role that it plays excluded by the cost recovery approach. We acknowledge that attributing GVA to water when water is only one of several inputs is incorrect; the GVA is derived from several inputs and will, therefore, overestimate the value of water. Using the GVA also involves double counting where for example water is valued for the grazing it provides to livestock and the livestock sales are reflected in the total GVA. However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure. Infrastructure includes formal infrastructure used by water user associations and municipalities, and informal infrastructure like private boreholes or even communal water supply mechanisms. We defined the URV as the present value of all costs (PVC), divided by the present value of all of yields or savings and benefits (PVB) incurred over the economic life span of the water supply infrastructure. Total yield is estimated by multiplying the expected annual yield with the supply scheme/infrastructure life span. This value is presented in a volumetric unit ($/m3) and is considered to be a minimum estimate of the relative value of water. URV is therefore a reversed benefit cost ratio (BCR), (BCR ¼ 1/URV). Thisvalue should only be used for comparing the different water supply alternatives in the same region, since the actual values of a unit of water vary widely in the different areas and the accepted cost per m3 will differ as well. In addition the URV is heavily dependant on the consistency of counting all the different cost and benefits that occur over the set life span of the supply scheme, which is debatable too. We extracted data from a provincial survey (De Lange, 2006) on water user associations in the Western Cape to obtain estimates regarding tariffs and volumes relevant to our study area. The survey excluded the City of Cape Town metropolis, but still represented 53.1% of all municipal and agricultural water use in the Western Cape (De Lange and Kleynhans, 2007, 2008). Cost data relating to the type of bulk supply infrastructure, source of supply, number of members, enlistment, types of user and annual tariffs were obtained from water user associations relevant to our study area (De Lange, 2006).

In addition to this method we estimated the total value of the economy (GVA) as an indication of the upper value of the water services, and therefore includes those benefits and the ecological role that it plays excluded by the cost recovery approach. We acknowledge that attributing GVA to water when water is only one of several inputs is incorrect; the GVA is derived from several inputs and will, therefore, overestimate the value of water. Using the GVA also involves double counting where for example water is valued for the grazing it provides to livestock and the livestock sales are reflected in the total GVA. However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure. Infrastructure includes formal infrastructure used by water user associations and municipalities, and informal infrastructure like private boreholes or even communal water supply mechanisms. We defined the URV as the present value of all costs (PVC), divided by the present value of all of yields or savings and benefits (PVB) incurred over the economic life span of the water supply infrastructure. Total yield is estimated by multiplying the expected annual yield with the supply scheme/infrastructure life span. This value is presented in a volumetric unit ($/m3) and is considered to be a minimum estimate of the relative value of water. URV is therefore a reversed benefit cost ratio (BCR), (BCR ¼ 1/URV). Thisvalue should only be used for comparing the different water supply alternatives in the same region, since the actual values of a unit of water vary widely in the different areas and the accepted cost per m3 will differ as well. In addition the URV is heavily dependant on the consistency of counting all the different cost and benefits that occur over the set life span of the supply scheme, which is debatable too.

We adopted a cost recovery approach (Lange and Hassan, 2006) in determining a minimum estimate for the value of the water services of the Succulent Karoo which excludes any benefits or value derived from that water, and ignores the role that ecosystems play in the supply of water. In addition to this method we estimated the total value of the economy (GVA) as an indication of the upper value of the water services, and therefore includes those benefits and the ecological role that it plays excluded by the cost recovery approach. We acknowledge that attributing GVA to water when water is only one of several inputs is incorrect; the GVA is derived from several inputs and will, therefore, overestimate the value of water. Using the GVA also involves double counting where for example water is valued for the grazing it provides to livestock and the livestock sales are reflected in the total GVA. However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure. Infrastructure includes formal infrastructure used by water user associations and municipalities, and informal infrastructure like private boreholes or even communal water supply mechanisms. We defined the URV as the present value of all costs (PVC), divided by the present value of all of yields or savings and benefits (PVB) incurred over the economic life span of the water supply infrastructure. Total yield is estimated by multiplying the expected annual yield with the supply scheme/infrastructure life span. This value is presented in a volumetric unit ($/m3) and is considered to be a minimum estimate of the relative value of water. URV is therefore a reversed benefit cost ratio (BCR), (BCR ¼ 1/URV). Thisvalue should only be used for comparing the different water supply alternatives in the same region, since the actual values of a unit of water vary widely in the different areas and the accepted cost per m3 will differ as well. In addition the URV is heavily dependant on the consistency of counting all the different cost and benefits that occur over the set life span of the supply scheme, which is debatable too.

However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure.

The topography is flat and gently undulating, disrupted by hills in places. The biome can be divided into five broad physiographic regions with the northern region divided into coastal plains and mountains, the south central region divided into mountains and plains, hills and lowlands, and the eastern most region all being distinctly separate (Mucina and Rutherford, 2006). The altitude varies from sea level to 1500m, but most lies below 800m(Mucina et al., 2006). Rainfall is regarded and highly predictable and mostly cyclonic falling during the winter months between April and September and varies between 100 and 300 mm per year, with and average of 170 mm (Mucina and Rutherford, 2006).

Journal of Arid Environments, 75(6), 612-623.",2011,"Corresponding value using Cost Recovery = $830.38 /// Total area providing the valued service per town is not mentioned. /// We calculated an upper and lower estimate for the value of water in the study area based on two approaches. We adopted a cost recovery approach (Lange and Hassan, 2006) in determining a minimum estimate for the value of the water services of the Succulent Karoo which excludes any benefits or value derived from that water, and ignores the role that ecosystems play in the supply of water. In addition to this method we estimated the total value of the economy (GVA) as an indication of the upper value of the water services, and therefore includes those benefits and the ecological role that it plays excluded by the cost recovery approach. We acknowledge that attributing GVA to water when water is only one of several inputs is incorrect; the GVA is derived from several inputs and will, therefore, overestimate the value of water. Using the GVA also involves double counting where for example water is valued for the grazing it provides to livestock and the livestock sales are reflected in the total GVA. However, water is arguably the one input without which there would be no economic activity so the GVA per unit of water is arguably closer to the upper bound of water’s economic value to society than the cost of water provision. The cost recovery approach value estimate was based on a unit reference value (URV) for water provisioning multiplied by the volume of water (annual yield) of the supply infrastructure. Infrastructure includes formal infrastructure used by water user associations and municipalities, and informal infrastructure like private boreholes or even communal water supply mechanisms. We defined the URV as the present value of all costs (PVC), divided by the present value of all of yields or savings and benefits (PVB) incurred over the economic life span of the water supply infrastructure. Total yield is estimated by multiplying the expected annual yield with the supply scheme/infrastructure life span. This value is presented in a volumetric unit ($/m3) and is considered to be a minimum estimate of the relative value of water. URV is therefore a reversed benefit cost ratio (BCR), (BCR ¼ 1/URV). Thisvalue should only be used for comparing the different water supply alternatives in the same region, since the actual values of a unit of water vary widely in the different areas and the accepted cost per m3 will differ as well. In addition the URV is heavily dependant on the consistency of counting all the different cost and benefits that occur over the set life span of the supply scheme, which is debatable too. We extracted data from a provincial survey (De Lange, 2006) on water user associations in the Western Cape to obtain estimates regarding tariffs and volumes relevant to our study area. The survey excluded the City of Cape Town metropolis, but still represented 53.1% of all municipal and agricultural water use in the Western Cape (De Lange and Kleynhans, 2007, 2008). Cost data relating to the type of bulk supply infrastructure, source of supply, number of members, enlistment, types of user and annual tariffs were obtained from water user associations relevant to our study area (De Lange, 2006). A distinction was made between serviced and raw water, with the former being significantly more expensive because of additional built in services (filtration, chlorination, stabilisation and pressurisation). Borehole water was handled separately. Cost estimates for each source were based on survey data and reconciled with unpublished estimates from theWestern Cape provincial department of Agriculture’s engineering services unit (De Lange, 2006). We calculated from the survey data (De Lange, 2006) that 85.3% of the surface water consumed in the study area is sold as raw surface water at $ 0.018/m3 while the remaining 14.7% is supplied as serviced water at $ 0.674/m3. Ground water was supplied at $ 0.106/m3 as raw water. The weighted average (volumetric weighted) cost recovery value of surface water was $ 0.115/m3 for the survey. These estimates were multiplied with annual surface and ground water yield estimates obtained at quaternary catchment level.
